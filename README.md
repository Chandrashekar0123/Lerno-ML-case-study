 Steps in Machine Learning :


1. Import Libraries : 
Import the necessary library files and dependencies.
2. Load the Dataset : 
Read and load the dataset into your environment for analysis.
3. Preprocess the Data : 
Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, scaling, encoding, etc.
4. Split the Dataset : 
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
5. Build the Model : 
Define and configure the machine learning model.
6. Train the Model : 
Fit the training dataset to the model to learn from the data.
7. Test the Model : 
Use the testing dataset to make predictions and evaluate generalization.
8. Evaluate Model Performance : 
Assess the modelâ€™s accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., using appropriate metrics.


1. HIERARCHICAL_CLUSTERING : 
Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that organizes data into a hierarchy of clusters, visualized through a dendrogram. It uses agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) methods and is commonly applied in bioinformatics and market segmentation.

2. KNN : 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised algorithm that predicts outcomes based on the k closest data points using a distance metric. It is simple and effective for classification and regression, often used in recommendation systems and anomaly detection.

3. K_Means : 
K-Means clustering partitions data into k clusters by iteratively refining cluster centroids to minimize intra-cluster variance. It is widely used in customer segmentation and pattern recognition.

4. Logistic_Regression : 
Logistic regression is a supervised learning method used for binary or multi-class classification. It models probabilities using a sigmoid function and is commonly applied in medical and financial predictions.

5. Multiple_Linear_Regression : 
Multiple linear regression predicts a target variable based on multiple independent variables using a linear equation. It is widely used in forecasting and understanding variable relationships.

6. SVM : 
Support Vector Machines (SVM) classify data by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates classes. It is robust to high-dimensional data and is used in text classification and bioinformatics.

7. Simple_Linear_Regression : 
Simple linear regression models the relationship between a single independent variable and a target variable using a straight line. It is used in basic trend analysis and prediction tasks.

8. k_means_iris : 
This applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to the Iris dataset, grouping flowers into clusters based on their features. It demonstrates unsupervised learning for pattern discovery.
